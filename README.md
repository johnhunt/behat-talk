Behat talk demo material

The website and API used in this demo were taken from https://github.com/akrabat/slim-bookshelf-api
- to have a go yourself, please set that up as per its README.md file.

Big thanks to the Slim team and Rob for that one.

Please feel free to contact me either on the Slim slack channel (https://slimphp-slack-invite.herokuapp.com) which is best, or by Twitter @johnrh

Cheers,
John.

ps - This is a WIP.
